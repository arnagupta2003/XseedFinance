      <h5 class="infoHead">How to use our Dreams Come True Calculator?</h5><br/>

      <b class="infoSubHead">Price tag on your dreams</b><br/> 
      How much will my dream cost me? What is the price
      tag on your dream item? Try to work out a specific amount, weather it is a
      few hundred dollars for a new phone, a few thousand dollars for a new TV
      or holiday, or hundreds of thousands of dollars for a house deposit.
      <br/> <br/> <b class="infoSubHead">Initial Savings</b><br/> 
      How much do I already have? Have you already started
      saving toward your goal? Or do you have existing savings you can dedicate
      towards it? Don’t worry if you are starting at 0 – you’re starting today!
      <br/> <br/> <b class="infoSubHead">Monthly savings</b><br/> 
      How much can I save every month? Planning the amount you
      will save is a delicate balance. The more you can save, the quicker you
      will reach your goal. But try to be realistic about how much you can spare
      to avoid a budget blow-out. Our Budget Calculator is a useful tool.
      <br/> <br/> <b class="infoSubHead">Interest rate</b><br/> 
      Put your money to work. If you will be saving for a period
      of time, it is a good idea to put your savings into a separate savings
      account. That way your money will earn interest and generate even more
      money while you wait.
